`hypervisor` is a Rust library that taps into functionality that enables hardware-accelerated execution of
virtual machines on OS X.

It binds to the [Hypervisor](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/hypervisor) framework on OS X, and exposes a safe Rust interface through the `hypervisor` module, and an unsafe foreign function interface through the `hypervisor::ffi` module.

[Documentation](https://saurvs.github.io/hypervisor-rs/)

## Prerequisites

To use this library, you need

* OS X Yosemite (10.10), or newer

* an Intel processor with the VT-x feature set that includes Extended Page
Tables (EPT) and the Unrestricted Mode. To verify this, run and expect the
following in your Terminal:
  ```shell
  $ sysctl kern.hv_support
  kern.hv_support: 1
  ```
